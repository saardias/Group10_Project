Cards War instructions:

Each turn every player picks a card from the top of the deck.

The player with the higher card is the winner of the current turn.


Each player gets points according to the values of his cards on the board.
The points are used when two players draw cards that have the same value.
In this case, the winner is the player with more points.



The premium player can change his current card with the top card of the deck. He can do it 3 times in a game.

When he does it, he automatically receives the higher card between the two cards that he drew.



The winner of the game is the one who has won the most rounds.
